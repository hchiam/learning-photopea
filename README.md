# Learning [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com)

Basically Photoshop, except free, and legal, and in your browser.

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

## Example SVG export from Photopea

```bash
open demo.html
```

## Quick reminders

- **Ctrl+F** lets you type command name and run it. (It also shows the keyboard shortcut.) This functionality reminds me of Ctrl+Shift+P in VS Code.

- "Pen" --> click dots = **polygon**.

- Curves: "Pen" --> click+drag = **path with curves** (Bézier ones).

- You can practice drawing Bézier curves at <https://bezier.method.ac>

- Other things like rotation, selection, blur, layers, subtraction, etc. remind me of GIMP. Except the interface is basically Photoshop.

- This only flips one layer, and doesn't work on SVG layers: Edit > Transform > Flip Horizontally.

- This flips the **_entire_** file/image, and **_works_** on **_SVG_** layers: **_Image_** > Transform > Flip Horizontally.
